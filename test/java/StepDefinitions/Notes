# Background: This is used to define all the common steps that multiple

  # scenarios have in the same feature file, till the time flow is not broken

    #===================================PARAMETERIZATION================================
  #when we use same test case with multiple set of test data we called this parameterization

  #HOOKS: For defining pre and Post steps in any Cucumber framework
      #     : This is always created inside the StepDefinitions folder
      #     : Hooks will take care of pre and post conditions irrespective
      #     : of what goes in between the test steps

      #BACKGROUND: Its the clubbing of common steps in different scenarios of a feature file
     #  till flow is not broken
     #1. Hard Code
     #2. Config file

     #-----------------Cucumber itself provides multiple option through which we can feed data from

     # feature file into Step Definition---------------------------------------------
     #3. Regular Expressions
         # put the data in double quotes [""]

    #4. Scenario Outline
        # Provides you an alternative to Data driven testing
        # Also supports parametrization
        rules:
      =>  if you want to use parameterization
      =>  if you have to use implement data driven testing
      =>  Scenario Outline is always used along with the keyword 'Examples'






  //tidy gherkin is a third party tool this can generate your code in reg expression (we dont use this now) now this code
  can generate our ide


  if their is huge set of data go with config file way
  if their is limited set of data use reg expression
